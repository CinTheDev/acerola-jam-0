# Acerola jam game

This is a game dedicated to the Acerola Jam 0.

The theme is ABERRATION.

## Idea development

The core game will be developed here. There will always be a list of ideas below each point, and then a subheader for exploring ideas further.

- Modifying the laws of physics
- Something parasitic
- Change in life
- Fitting into society
- Cooking game with suspicious ingredients

### Modifying the laws of physics

- A specific physics law is changed in some way (e.g. an equation), and the result must be analyzed so that interesting and hardly predictable gameplay mechanics can emerge from that simple change.
- A story on how the world has been destroyed by some kind of astronomical event, altering the world as we know it in some horrible way
- You are a person with a magic blessing / curse and have to continue life somehow (inspired from the tale of Midas)
