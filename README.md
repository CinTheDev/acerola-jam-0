### Modifying the laws of physics

- A specific physics law is changed in some way (e.g. an equation), and the result must be analyzed so that interesting and hardly predictable gameplay mechanics can emerge from that simple change.
- A story on how the world has been destroyed by some kind of astronomical event, altering the world as we know it in some horrible way
- You are a person with a magic blessing / curse and have to continue life somehow (inspired from the tale of Midas)

### Something parasitic

- You are a parasite inside a host
- You are the host of parasites and have to get rid of them somehow

### Change in life

- You are just living your life, and an unexpected event redefines your world view, self image, and life goals.

### Fitting into society

- You are a member of society, and for some reason everybody has turned against you. Now you need to hide somehow, and survive.

### Cooking game with suspicious ingredients

- You are a master cook inside of a third world country, which has declared war, and now only have very limited ingredients with questionable quality. You must ensure that your customers don't die or experience other undesired side effects.
