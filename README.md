# Acerola jam game

This is a game dedicated to the Acerola Jam 0.

The theme is ABERRATION.

## Idea development

The core game will be developed here. There will always be a list of ideas below each point, and then a subheader for exploring ideas further.

- Modifying the laws of physics
- Something parasitic
- Change in life
- Fitting into society
- Cooking game with suspicious ingredients

### Modifying the laws of physics

- A specific physics law is changed in some way (e.g. an equation), and the result must be analyzed so that interesting and hardly predictable gameplay mechanics can emerge from that simple change.
- A story on how the world has been destroyed by some kind of astronomical event, altering the world as we know it in some horrible way
- You are a person with a magic blessing / curse and have to continue life somehow (inspired from the tale of Midas)

#### Modified physics law

- Specific formula in dynamics (or it's bases like mechanics or kinematics) modified
- Laws of thermodynamics don't hold anymore, allowing impossible constructions to exploit infinite energy, or similar
- Chemistry becomes very constrained; elements become very unreactive
- Every object is locked in rotation, rotation is impossible without dissasembling and rearranging the object itself

##### Changed formula / equation

- Changing the way force behaves (F = m * a)
- Making gravity not decrease with distance

##### Broken thermodynamics

- First law no longer holds; energy can now be destroyed or created from nothing
- Second law no longer holds; energy can collect (e.g. cold flows into hot) instead of spreading out

#### Magic blessing / curse

- Everything you touch becomes gold (kinda familiar idea)
- A specific law of physics doesn't apply to you anymore (e.g. gravity, collision, ...)

### Something parasitic

- You are a parasite inside a host
- You are the host of parasites and have to get rid of them somehow

### Change in life

- You are just living your life, and an unexpected event redefines your world view, self image, and life goals.

### Fitting into society

- You are a member of society, and for some reason everybody has turned against you. Now you need to hide somehow, and survive.

### Cooking game with suspicious ingredients

- You are a master cook inside of a third world country, which has declared war, and now only have very limited ingredients with questionable quality. You must ensure that your customers don't die or experience other undesired side effects.
